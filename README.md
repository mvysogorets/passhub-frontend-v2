# passhub-frontend-v2

The project is seriously rewritten https://github.com/wwpass/passhub-frontend. The first version was a CRA-based React with classes, while now it is functional React with react-query.

The PassHub frontend is a client-side part of the PassHub password manager. When deploying self-hosted PassHub, copy the compiled package into the /frontend directory of the PassHub instance

The server side of the PassHub and deployment instructions can be found at https://github.com/wwpass/passhub.
